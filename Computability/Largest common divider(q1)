Give an algorithm for finding the largest natural number that divides two given natural numbers. Does your algorithm satisfy
Mal`cev`s criteria?(Please, describe your algorithm in English, not "computerese".)

First pick out two numbers and compare them. If the numbers are equal, then the result is one of the numbers. If not, then take
the smaller number and divide the bigger number with it. If the bigger number is divisible by the smaller one, then the result
is the smaller number. If it is not divisible, then substract one from the smaller number and check if the two natural numbers
are divisible by the number preceding smaller number. If it is divisible, then the number preceding the smaller number is the 
result. If not, keep subtstracting one from the smaller number and checking if the two numbers are divisible by that number 
until you find the largest commom dividor.
