Do you agree that the dice-rolling procedure of B.1 is mechanical, but not computable? How could you use Mal1cev`s criterion 
(b) to rule it out? (Be careful not to implicitly use the notion of computability in explaining what you mean by "determined.")

On one hand it may seem that the system is deterministic, as in the case of rolling dice the result will be uniquely determined
by the conditions in the preceding moment in time (criterion (b)). But on the other hand the mechanical system may be so 
sensitive to the initial conditions that the numbers on the rolled dice can be actually determined on the quantum level. At this
point we could consider the system truly random and the dice rolling system mechanical, but not computable.
