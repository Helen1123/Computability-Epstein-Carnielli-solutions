Let A be any countable collection, which we shall call the alphabet; for example, A could be the letters of the Roman alphabet
or it could be the rationals. Define a word to be any concatenation (finite sequence) of the objects in A, for example, abaabx 
or 1/2 0 1/2 1/2. Show that the collection of words over A is countable.

Based on the theorem that we proved about all the tuples of all natural numbers being computable (and if we assign any letter
in the alphabet to the natural number) we can conclude that all of the words upon this alphabet are enumerable, if the alphabet
itself is enumerable).
