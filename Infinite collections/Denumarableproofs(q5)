Show that following are denumerable:

a. All triples of natural numbers.
b. All n-tuples of natural numbers for a fixed n.
c. The collection of all n-tuples of natural numbers for all n 
(Hint: Divide N into countably many countably infinite sets by taking the nth set for n>=1 to be all those numbers divisible 
by 2*(n-1) and no higher power of 2.)
d. Every subset of a denumerable set (Hint:It`s immediate for finite subsets. Otherwise pick it out from an enumeration of the
whole set.)

a. All triples of natural numbers are enumerable, because it is a composition of two bijections such as:
J(k,J(m,n)).

b. All triples of natural numbers are enumerable, because it is a composition of n bijections such as:
J(xn,J(xn-1, J(xn-2...J(x1,x2))).

c. We can map a collection of all n-tuples in the following way: we have the coding function for J(x,y), which we can turn 
into a coding function for any n-tuple, by composition it with itself as shown before. Then we can create another function that 
will enumerate all the n-tuples by J(l,n), where the l is the number that we have from the encoding function, and the n number 
for every n-tuple. We have shown before that the coding function is a bijection. That means that our function is also a
bijection, as it is a combination of bijections. 

d. Every subset that is finite can be enumerated by a bijection function, if not in the analytical form, then in the explicit
form, like a table of (x,y) pairs for example.
Every element of the subset by the definition belongs to the original set. That means it is possible to go through every element
of a set and check if it is an element of a subset. And every time you go through the element that belongs to a subset you 
can effectively enumerate it, as the initial subset is enumerable. This function is called inclusion mapping.
