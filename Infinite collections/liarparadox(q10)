Compare the proof that <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?a\not{\approx} P(A)" border="0"/> with the Liar paradox
and Russell`s set paradox.

All these proofs arise from the problem of the self-reference. But while the Cantor`s antimony is self-referencing to the 
notion of inclusivity, Liar`s paradox is self-referencing to the concept of being true or false (being a liar) and 
Russel`s set paradox is self-referencing to the notion of belonging to the set.
