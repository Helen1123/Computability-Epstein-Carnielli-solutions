Show that the following are countable:
a. The collection of all odd natural numbers.
b. The integers.
c. The collection of all primes.

a. There exists a bijection, where: f(n)=2n+1. 

b. There exists a bijection, where every odd natural numbers corresponds to positive integer and every even to negative integer.

c. Prime numbers are natural numbers, therefore, they are a subset of a countable set. Than they are countable too.
