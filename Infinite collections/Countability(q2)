Show that the following are countable:
a. The collection of all odd natural numbers.
b. The integers.
c. The collection of all primes.

a. There exists a bijection, where: f(n)=2n+1. 

b. There exists a bijection, where every odd natural numbers corresponds to positive integer and every even to negative integer.

c. There exists a bijection that checks every natural number and is it is true assigns it another natural number. It is 1-1,
because prime numbers are natural numbers, so they are situated on the number line in particular order, therefore there is 
one and only one natural number that indicates the order of the prime number. Also, every natural number has a corresponding 
prime number as proved by Euclid.
