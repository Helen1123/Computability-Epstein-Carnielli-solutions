Show that we cannot get  √7 from the rationals and  √2 by using addition, substraction, multiplication and division. That is, 
show that for all rational numbers a, b, c and d  √7 is not equal to a + (b√2)/c + (d√2).

Let`s assume that this is false. Then:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(b\sqrt{2}/c+d\sqrt{2})^{2}=(\sqrt{7}-a)^{2}" border="0"/>

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2b^{2}/c^{2}+2*2*\frac{b}{c}*d+2d^{2}=7-2\sqrt{7}a+a^{2}" border="0"/>

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2b^{2}/c^{2}+4\frac{bd}{c}+2d^{2}-7-a^{2}=-2\sqrt{7}a | :-2a " border="0"/>

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sqrt{7}=\frac{2b^{2}/c^{2}+4\frac{bd}{c}+2d^{2}-7-a^{2}}{-2a}" border="0"/>

From this equation we see that  √7 is calculated as some composition of rational numbers. But this is a contradiction, as we
proves before that  √7 is irrational. Therefore, this is a contradiction and our assumption about ability to get the  √7 from
rationals and  √2 is wrong.
