What is Plato`s conception of mathematical objects? According to him, what does it mean to say that a circle exists? 
that a number exists? Give a concise explanation of why you agree or disagree with Plato`s views. If Plato is right, how is it
that we can use mathematics to build bridges?

Plato`s point of view is that mathematical objects are more real than real world objects. According to him that means that the 
circle exists in our minds as an abstract object, circle is something that we can perceive by pure imagination. 

I don`t agree or disagree with the Plato`s view, beacuase I do not think there is a way to prove what is more real, objects 
outside or inside of our minds, as the concept of "being real" needs a definition that we do not have. And this definition can 
not be obtained as it will inevitably contain a self-reference paradox.
There is no way to tell if object exists or not, as both perception and imagination are brain`s children. And brain loves both 
it`s children, so strong that we can not sometimes distinguish reality from imagination (in a dream). 
If abstract objects are real, than there are no boundaries keeping us from construction bridges, as the real bridge will be the 
reflection of the model of the bridge in our minds. Does that mean that abstract objects are less real, because they are based 
on the objects from the outside world? In this case we come to the circulus vitious, as there is no way that I can think of, 
of us showing that objects on real world are not based on the pre-existing concepts in our heads.
