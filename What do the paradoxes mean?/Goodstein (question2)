In what ways does Goodstein view mathematics differently from Plato? Why would Goodstein`s resolution of Zeno`s paradoxes be
unacceptable to a platonist? Is Goodstein`s description of the resolution by means of the calculus apt?

Goodstein thinks that postulation of existence of even a mathematical entity is entirely spurious and in no way comparable to 
the invention of physical entity. For example e (Euler`s number) does not exist, because for it`s existence one has to complete
infinite action. 

Obviously a platonist, for whom the physical reality is a mere reflection of the abstract objects,Goodstein`s point would be 
unacceptable,as it is opposite. In his article, Goodsten argues that "symbolism is a source of error and misconception".

No. In the beginning Goodstein states "formal calculus leads back....is felt...as a barrier to the free expression of ideas".
