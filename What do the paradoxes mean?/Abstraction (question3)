Mathematicians often view their work as abstraction from experience. Is that viewpoint compatible with Plato`s? with 
Goodstein`s? Why?

It is compatible with the Plsto`s point of view, but not Goodstein`s. Plato perceives abstraction as a foremost object that a 
mathematician should work with and that physical objects are reflections of physical objects. While Goodstein argues that 
symbolism holds mathematics back and is the source of error and misconception.
