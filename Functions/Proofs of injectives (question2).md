a. Prove that on the natural numbers f(x)=3x+7 is 1-1.

This is a basic linear function, therefore to every input there will be one unique output. Then it is 1-1. 

b. Prove that <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lambda{x(x^{4}+2)" border="0"/> is not 1-1 on the real numbers.

If this function was 1-1 on the real numbers, then for all it`s outputs if f(x)=z and  f(y)=z, then x=y. But in the case of this 
function f(1)=f(-1). Therefore, it is not 1-1.
