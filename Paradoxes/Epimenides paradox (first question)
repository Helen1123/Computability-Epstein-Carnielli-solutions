Why is the paradox ascribed to Epimenedes not a paradox as stated? How can you make it paradoxical?

Paradox: Epimenides stated that "All Cretacean are liars". Was he speaking truly?

We can come to a conclusion that this is a paradox in case we assume that Epimenides is speaking truly. In that case all
cretaceans are liars, and so is Epimenides. If Epimenides is a liar than he was not speaking truly. But than statement 
"All Cretaceans are liars" is false, which means that some of Cretaceans may be honest and some not. That means that
Eupimenides lied and his statement was false. 
So this "paradox" can be resolved if we assume the statement is false. 

This paradox may be transformed into proper paradox: Eubulides paradox. "What I am saying right now is a lie". Which has no 
solution.
