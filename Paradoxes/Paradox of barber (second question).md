Resolve the paradox of the barber. Can you resolve Russell`s set theory paradox in the same way?

The barber paradox: There is a barber who shaves everyone who does not shave themselves. Does he shave himself?
Russell`s set theory paradox:

The solution is simple: this barber does not exist.
Yes, the Russell`s set theory paradox is solved in the same way.
