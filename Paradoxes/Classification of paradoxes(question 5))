The paradoxes and puzzles from A seem to be very much the same, but by working through these exercises you should begin to 
see differences. Try to contrast and classify the paradoxes according to principles which can be used to resolve them or 
principles they call into question.

Let`s first see what basic paradox classifications are out there:

Hughes. 
1.Paradoxes of self-reference. E.g: liar paradox, barber paradox, "this statement is false".
2.Paradoxes of contradiction: This statement is false -- cannot be true or false at the same time. Or wish to the genie for your 
wishes to not come true.
3.Vicious circularity or infinite regress: paradoxes with the pieces of paper, e.g. the statement on the other side is false, the 
traveller in time (grandfather paradox).

Quine.
1.Veridical paradoxes, or riddles that ar first do not make sense, but there is some clever explanation: Frederic`s birthday 
paradox (birthday that comes on the leap day), Arrow`s impossibility paradox, Monty Hall Paradox, Hilbert`s Grand Hotel paradox,
Schroedinger`s cat paradox. 
2. Falsidial paradoxes: 1=2, Horse paradox, Zeno`s paradoxes. 
3. Antinomies: Grelling-Nelson paradox (heterological is heterological).
4. Dialetheia, "true contradictions" or nondualisms: both true and false. 

Then let`s try to distinguish and group paradoxes in the paragraph A:

Resolution methods.
1)Resolution by assuming the statement is false.
2)Resolution by assuming that the such objects does not exist.
3)Resolutions by doubting the logic principles used. 
4)Resolutions by construction of another thought experiment.
5)Resolution by vicious circling.
Principles doubted. 
1)The self-referring of the object to itself.
2)Infinity.
3)Basic logical principles.
