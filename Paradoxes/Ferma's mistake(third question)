There is a fallacy in the purported letter from Fermat to Descartes, which surely Descarted would have spotted. 
What is it? (Hint: What other conclusion could Fermat have drawn?) Is this the same as the paradox of the barber?

The letter: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2320647?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents

First, being selfless means that one thinks only about selfless persons, but it does not necessarily mean that at some point 
one will think about one particular selfless person out of potential infinity (in this case him/herself), as this will mean 
that one completed an infinite task in a lifetime span. Therefore, one can be a selfless person without thinking about 
him/herself.

Second, we can derive that it is not that one who does not exist, but that the selfless persons do not exist. And in this case 
the solution mimics the one drawn for the barber`s paradox. So that, Fermat`s conclusion contains a fallacy concerning 
existence of every person, instead of a selfless person.
