We will prove that in every finite collection of natural numbers all of the numbers are equal, using induction in the number of
natural numbers in the collection:
The statement is true for any collection with just one natural number,a, for a=a.
Now suppose it is true for any collection n of natural numbers.
Let a1,a2,...an,an+1 be any collection of n+1 natural numbers.
By induction hypothesis, a1=a2=a3=...=an. But also we have a2=...=an=an+1, because here, too, there are only n numbers. And so 
a1=a2=...=an=an+1.
What is wrong with this 'proof'?

Statement a2=...=an=an+1 is not proven. "There are only n numbers is not an explanation.
