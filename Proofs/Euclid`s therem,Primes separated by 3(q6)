a. In his "Introduction" Goodstein sketches the a proof of Euclid`s Theorem that given any prime p we can find another prime 
between p and p!+1. Write up that proof in mathematical notation filling in all the details.

b. Prove that there is not an unlimited number of primes separated by 3: that is, show that there is some number n such that 
there are no numbers p and p+3 greater than n that are prime. Does this mean that we have completed an endless task of checking 
all the primes?

The first prime number is 2. After that by the definition of prime numbers, all the prime number are odd.
Then for all prime numbers after 2, we have p, that is odd. Then p+3 is a sum of two odd numbers: p and 3.
The sum of 2 odd numbers is always even. Even is not prime. That means that the only pair of prime numbers separated by 3 is 2
and 5.
