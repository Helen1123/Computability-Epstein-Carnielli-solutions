A platonist would disagree with Hilbert on many points, but most fundamentally on what justifies our use of infinities in 
mathematics. Explain.

The main problem that Hilbert has with infinity is that he thinks that it does not exist in reality, and therefore it is the 
main source of inconsistencies. Plato would despise such explanation, as he thinks that real objects are the one that are in 
our heads.
